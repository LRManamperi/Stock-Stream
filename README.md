# Stock-Stream

Real-Time Stock Market Data Platform using Spring Boot, Kafka, GraphQL, React, and Nginx for load balancing.

Overview
StockPulse provides real-time stock price updates and financial news streaming using:
‚úÖ Kafka for event-driven stock price updates.
‚úÖ GraphQL for efficient data fetching and subscriptions.
‚úÖ Spring Boot for backend processing and APIs.
‚úÖ React for the interactive stock market dashboard.
‚úÖ Nginx for load balancing API requests.

Chart Enhancements
Live Updates: Make the StockChart component dynamically update as new stock data comes in, ensuring the chart reflects real-time data without needing a page refresh.
Zooming & Panning: Allow users to zoom into a specific timeframe or pan across the data to analyze trends.
Chart Type Toggle: Enable users to toggle between different chart types (e.g., line chart, candlestick chart) to view the data in various ways.
2. Historical Data & Filtering
Time Range Filter: Implement a feature that allows users to filter stock data based on a specific time range (e.g., last hour, last 24 hours, last week).
Maximum Stock Price Query: Allow users to query and display the maximum stock price over a specified period (e.g., last 30 minutes, last 24 hours).
GraphQL Integration: Use the getMaxStockPrice GraphQL query to provide historical stock data analysis.
3. User Interface Improvements
Loading State: Display a loading spinner or animation when the WebSocket connection is being established.
Error Handling: Show an error message or retry option if there is an issue with the WebSocket connection.
Notification System: Add notifications to alert users when stock price updates reach a certain threshold or exhibit significant changes.
UI Themes: Implement a dark/light mode toggle to improve user experience in different environments.
Stock Ticker: Display a live stock ticker or a simple list of the most recent stock prices.
4. Data Export/Download
CSV Export: Allow users to export the real-time stock data to a CSV file for further analysis.
Historical Data Export: Let users select a date range and export historical stock data.
5. Alerts & Notifications
Threshold Alerts: Implement a feature where users can set price threshold alerts. If a stock‚Äôs price crosses a set limit, users can receive a notification.
Email/SMS Alerts: Integrate an alert system that sends notifications via email or SMS if stock prices meet certain conditions.
